    <strong>App Sessions on Fogo</strong>

Fogo Sessions is an open-source standard for Web3 app sessions on Fogo.

Fogo Sessions helps Fogo app developers to provide a great user experience to their users by:
- enabling their apps to be used with any Solana wallet (even those that don't support Fogo!)
- enabling gasless transactions. No more sending some dust to your address to rescue stranded funds!
- reducing the number of times the user needs to sign with their wallet. They only need to sign once to log in!
