Fogo Sessions is an open-source standard for Web3 app sessions on Fogo.
Fogo Sessions allow app developers to provide a frictionless app experience to Solana Virtual Machine users.
When visiting an app that uses Fogo Sessions, users just have to sign with their browser wallet once at log in. Once logged in, the user can perform on-chain actions seamlessly.  
It supports every Solana wallet (even those that don't support Fogo yet).
